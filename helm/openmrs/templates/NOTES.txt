Congratulations! OpenMRS has been successfully deployed!

It may take a few minutes for the OpenMRS application to be accessible. You can watch the status by running
and waiting for all pods to be ready:

kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

To access the service via Ingress Nginx run:
   kubectl -n ingress-nginx port-forward svc/ingress-nginx-controller 8080:80

NOTE: In case port-forward command does not work, make sure that Ingress Controller name is correct.
      Check the services in Ingress Nginx (e.g. ingress-nginx) namespace using:
        kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc

OpenMRS will be available at:
  http://localhost:8080

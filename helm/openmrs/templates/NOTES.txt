Congratulations! OpenMRS has been successfully deployed!

It may take a few minutes for the OpenMRS application to be accessible. You can watch the status by running
and waiting for all pods to be ready:

kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

To access the service run:
  kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} port-forward svc/gateway 8080:80

NOTE: In case port-forward command does not work, make sure that OpenMRS Gateway name is correct.
      Check the services in {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace using:
        kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get svc

OpenMRS will be available at:
  http://localhost:8080
